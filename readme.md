# Anaphoricity in emojis
This is a repository of code and data used for the experiment investigating the anaphoric interpretation of emojis. The experiment was conducted as a final project for the Psycholinguistics class I took in the winter semester 2024/25 at Universite Paris Cite as a part of the Theoretical and Experimental Linguistics programme. Besides me, the project was also developed by Alicja Caban, Lara Tomic and the class TA Nick Griffin.
